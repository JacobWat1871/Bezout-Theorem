Algorithm that calculates value of a polymonial on given argument and function formula. It also checks if the given argument is root of polymonial. 
Unfortunetelly it works only for full polymonials without missing monomial ex. "x^4+2x^3-5x^2+2x-3" for that function it will work, but for "x^4+2x^3+2x-3" it won't work.
I would like to update that in the future so for the function like this: "x^4+2x^3+2x-3" it will work to.
